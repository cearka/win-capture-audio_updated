# go look at the original for info about this plugin.


# I do not use this.  

I have a friend who relies on this plugin and it's been janky AF for her after she moved to newest OBS.  this is my attempt at fixing a bunch of issues with the plugin.
She's currently on OBS 31 and updated windows 10.  it seems to work fine with my changes.

I'm not updating this or maintaining this for others, so if you have issues with it still I probably won't have the time to help you.  sorry.
